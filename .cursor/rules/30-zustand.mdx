# Zustand

- In components, always select the smallest slice (`useStore(s => s.x)`), never the whole store.
- Avoid storing derived state; compute via selectors when possible.
- Async actions: use a typed status (`idle|loading|success|error`) when UI depends on it.
- Keep store boundaries by feature/domain, not one global mega-store.
