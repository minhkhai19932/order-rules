# English Comments Required (React/TS)

For every generated or modified code in TS/TSX files:

## Mandatory doc comments

Add an English doc comment directly above:

- Every React component (function component)
- Every custom hook (functions starting with `use`)
- Every exported function
- Every exported type/interface/enum that represents domain concepts
- Every Zustand store action (if present)

If the file contains internal helper functions:

- Add at least a 1-line English doc comment above each helper unless it is a trivial one-liner.
- For non-trivial helpers, include params/returns/edge cases.

## Comment style

- Use JSDoc/TSDoc style `/** ... */`.
- Comments must explain purpose and constraints (“why/what”), not restate obvious code.
- Keep comments short and accurate. Update comments when behavior changes.
- Do not add noisy comments like “This is a button component” unless it clarifies intent/constraints.

## Required content guidelines

- Components: purpose + key behavior + important props + accessibility notes if relevant.
- Hooks: purpose + returned values + side effects (subscriptions, timers, network) + cleanup behavior.
- Functions: purpose + params + returns + throws (if applicable) + important invariants.
- Store actions: purpose + what state changes + error handling/side effects.

## Example templates

Component:
"""
/\*\*

- Renders <what> for <who/where>.
- Key behavior: <1-2 bullet lines>.
- Accessibility: <notes if relevant>.
  \*/
  """

Hook:
"""
/\*\*

- Encapsulates <domain/UI> state for <feature>.
- Returns: <main returned values>.
- Side effects: <fetch/subscription/timers>, cleanup: <how>.
  \*/
  """

Function:
"""
/\*\*

- Computes/Transforms <X> for <Y>.
- @param ...
- @returns ...
- @throws ...
  \*/
  """
