# React Components

- Use function components + hooks only.
- Keep components focused; move business logic to hooks/services/stores.
- `useEffect` only for side effects; do not hide core logic inside effects.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders: stable props, avoid inline heavy objects/functions when it matters.
